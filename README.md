# go-pray
Moslem Prayer Time built using Golang & Termui (https://github.com/gizak/termui)

Data is retrieved / scraped from http://jadwalsholat.pkpu.or.id/ using Colly (github.com/gocolly/colly)

For now, the prayer time is only for Jakarta - Indonesia, I will do some enhancement to add some interesting feature & refactoring it in my free time :)
